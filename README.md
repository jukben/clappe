Tiny extension to make your claps be heard on Medium. Also providing super clap functionality if you want to be really supportive as a crowd.

### How to use

The extenstion itself is created to be the easiest as possible but still you can check it out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSXIfH3N8Cc).

Basically, every time (when you are allowed to clap) when you hover a clap button an another special button "super-clapp" appears. If you press this button, the article what you are currently reading will gain up to 50 claps.

This extension also has settings. You can disable sounds of claps or you can set your own â€“ personal one. Don't worry, it's not uploaded anywhere, this part of settings is completely private and saved localy. ðŸ¤“
