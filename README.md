## Introduction

The extension itself is created to be the easiest as possible but still you can check it out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSXIfH3N8Cc).

Basically, every time (if you're allowed to clap) when you hover a clap button an another special button "super-clapp" appears. If you press this button the article what you're currently reading will gain up to 50 claps.

This extension has also settings. You can disable sounds of claps or you can set your own â€“ personal one. Don't worry, it's not uploaded anywhere, this part of the settings is completely private and saved locally. ðŸ¤“
